\begin{xcb}{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let's probe the least squares solution a bit more closely.
\subitem Compute the sum of the squares of the residual errors using formula \eqref{eq:merit} and the solution in formula \eqref{eq:soln:particular}. 
\subitem Compute the residual fit error associated with each of the three measurements.
\subitem Add these errors quadratically to recover the answer found in the first part of the problem. 
\subitem What are the physical units on this number as compared to the units of measurement?
\end{enumerate}
