\chapter{What is a matrix?}

This preliminary chapter provides a quick review of linear algebra needed to develop the tools command the \svdp. More of the machinery of linear algebra will be developed as we continue to explore the SVD. The goal is to build a basic foundation and to clarify the SVD perspective of linear algebra.

A matrix represents several concepts and the interpretation of a matrix depends upon the context of usage. In terms of the SVD it helps to have a clear understanding of a matrix in terms of the induced vector spaces.
