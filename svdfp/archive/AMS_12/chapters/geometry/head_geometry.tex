\chapter{The geometry of the SVD}

The human eyes and brain are a marvelous system for processing visual information. We can use this to our advantage when studying the \svdp. There are many ways to approach the SVD and a few are explored in this book. One way which may be the favorite for a significant proportion of readers is the geometric approach of this chapter which relies heavily on visual presentation.

Part of the approach so far has relied on imagery to help convey the message. Block diagrams are used to prevent basic shape and size information. The null space vectors in the domain matrices are shaded. The sabot matrix is blocked using a horizontal and a vertical line. The goal is to foster visualization and to use imagination as a adjunct to memorization. 

We can extend the visualization to the area of greatest impact: the geometry of the SVD. In here we will ``see'' the singular values and how they are dilation factors. We will ``see'' how matrices act upon vectors. We will ``see'' how the domain matrices can be represented as rotation matrices, permutation matrices and their compositions. We will ``see''the collapse vector spaces onto lower dimensional objects. Hopefully, this will conjure a perception that the SVD is a geometric process as much as an algebraic process.
