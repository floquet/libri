\chapter[Proofs]{Proofs of the \svdl \ theorem}
As one may surmise, a powerful and elegant technique like \svdp \ invites analysts to devise a variety of proofs. This chapter reviews some of the more popular results.

Typically mathematics texts present material in the order of theorem$-$proof$-$applications. Clearly the order in this work is applications$-$theorem$-$proof. The central reason for this deviation from orthodoxy is that the SVD is a very powerful technique and the applications are more useful to many in the audience and the proof-first method does estrange a multitude of application-driven readers.  

Perhaps this experiment will be deemed suboptimal. But the wish is that the readers are well-versed in the need and utility of the SVD and are ready to frame their understanding in more formal terms. 

Certainly some readers are more interested in computation than analysis. Hopefully, some will read through the proofs and sharpen their insight into the SVD.
