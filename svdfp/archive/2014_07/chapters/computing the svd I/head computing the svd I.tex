\chapter[Computing the SVD I]{Computing the SVD I:\\the method}

The \ftola \ tells us about the four fundamental subspaces. The \asvd \ extends this concept by aligning the subspaces and showing the scale factors between the spaces. This extra information comes from resolving an eigensystem. The goals of the SVD are elementary yet the execution may be quite tedious.

This chapter presents methods for computing the \asvd.
