	\caption[Solution space for Bevington example]{Solution space $\brnga{*}$ for the Bevington example. The minimization occurs in codomain and is the projection of the measurement vector onto the range space $\brnga{}$. The solution is in the domain $\brnga{*}$ and this is the point which maps into to codomain.}
