\chapter[]{The singular values}

We can look at the singular values from different perspectives. One way already mentioned is to consider them as scaling factors bridging the domain and codomain matrices. We will come back to that in a moment. Another way is to consider them to be a set of amplitudes in an expansion of rank one matrices. This is a good visualization exercise and will prove useful when we revisit the topic of the method of least squares.
