\chapter[Singular values: Expansion amplitudes]{Singular values:\\ Expansion amplitudes}

\section{Introduction}
We have answered the most basic questions about the \svdp \ by showing two different ways to decompose a target matrix. With this requirement satisfied, we will move to more abstract issues. The next several chapters will focus on interpretation of the decomposition components. The goal is to foster an intuition for the domain matrices and the singular values. In particular the singular values are a minor hurdle. Of course the singular values are the square root of the eigenvalues of the product matrices. Yet there is much more that story.

While most of the elaboration will take place part \eqref{pictures} ``The SVD in pictures,'' there is an important analytic piece to resolve first. We will look at the generalized Fourier expansion and compare that to the SVD. We will see that the singular values play the role of the expansion amplitudes which regulate the summation of rank one matrices.

This will open the door to two concepts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item low-rank approximations of matrices, and
\item distance to higher-rank matrices.
\end{enumerate}
