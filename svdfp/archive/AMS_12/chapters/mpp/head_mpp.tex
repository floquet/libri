\chapter{The pseudoinverse}
\label{chap:pseudoinverse}
The pseudoinverse, or generalized matrix inverse, is a powerful tool in the study of linear systems. We have seen already how this generalization is a potent tool in the arena of least squares problems. We will go on to see that the pseudoinverse and the \svdl \ work together like hand and glove.
