\section{Generalized Fourier expansion}
In chapter 5 we looked at a generalized Fourier expansion for the target matrix using a sum of rank one matrices. We mentioned the trouble we would have with the pseudoinverse. While in the matrix decomposition we can happily discard the smallest singular values, we see that these are the values which contribute to the sum the most.

Rank one decomposition for the pseudoinverse:
\begin{equation}
  \Ap = \sum_{k=1}^{rho} {\sigma_{k}^{-1}x_{k}y_{k}^{\TT}}  = \sum_{k=1}^{rho} {\sigma_{k}^{-1}x_{k}\otimes y_{k}}
\end{equation}
