\chapter{Taxa of the SVD}

\section[The Fundamental Theorem]{The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra}
Part of the elegance and power of the SVD comes from the fact that it provides an orthogonal decomposition of the four fundamental subspaces. There are different ways to label the Four Fundamental Subspaces. There are two range spaces, which are the images of $\A{}$ and $\A{*}$. Each of these spaces has an orthogonal complement. It may be simply be called the orthogonal complement of the range space, or it may be called a null space.

\begin{enumerate}
\item SVD - the foundation class;
\item GSVD - the generalized SVD;
\item PSVD - the product SVD;
\item QSVD - the quotient SVD.
\end{enumerate}
