\chapter{Orthogonalization techniques}
\label{sec:ortho}

There are three popular techniques
The Gram-Schmidt process takes a set of vectors and provides an orthonormal set of basis vectors. This process has two primary uses in the \svdp:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To build an orthonormal basis for a null space given a set of vectors in the image;
\item To orthonormalize the set of null space vectors output from a matrix reduction.
\end{enumerate}
