\chapter[Probing the SVD]{Probing the SVD with the Jordan normal form}
The Jordan normal forms offer a unique probe of the \svdp. These forms will act like an x-ray machine and show the internal structure  of the decomposition: permutations, rotations is stark relief. We will be able to correlate the most difficult decompositions to the more complete Jordan structures.

In \S \eqref{sec:Jordan:basic} we will see that the simpler Jordan forms have some of the basic non-trivial decompositions. These forms will cleanly show how the coordinate systems are rotated.

In \S \eqref{sec:Jordan:full} we will encounter the most daunting \svdl s: the full Jordan forms. The message will be clear that the difficulty with these decompositions lies in resolving trigonometric functions of angles $\zeta \pi$ where $\zeta$ is irrational.

In general, the \svdl \ of the Jordan normal forms fall into one of two categories: trivial or painful. This is an opportunity to put your pencil down and look at the patterns in the text.
