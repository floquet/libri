\section{Chirality}
Chirality is an important concept which describes the ``handedness'' of the coordinate system. Even though we are restricted to $\real{2}$ in this discussion, we will see that we need to embed this plane in a third dimension.

Here we go from black to blue. Run your fingers along the black line. If they curl in the direction of the blue line, the system is \emph{right handed.} If you must use your left hand fingers to curl in the direction of the blue line then the system is \emph{left-handed.}
