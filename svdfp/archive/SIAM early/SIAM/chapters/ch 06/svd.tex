\section[The column vectors]{The column vectors of the domain matrices}
In this chapter we see the singular values\index{singular values!scale factors, as} are called scale factors. Consider the notion of distance. Every point in the domain maps to a point in the codomain. How does the distance between two points in the domain compare to the distance between these two points in the codomain?
\begin{equation}
  \A{}\X{}_{*,c} = \sigma_{c} \Y{}_{*,c}, \quad c = 1, \rho.
\end{equation}
