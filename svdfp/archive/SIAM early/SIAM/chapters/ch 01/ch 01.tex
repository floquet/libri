Consider the quadratic equation
\begin{equation}
  ax^{2}+bx+c = 0.
\end{equation}
We know that the two roots are given by
\begin{equation}
  x_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2a}\paren{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}.
\end{equation}
However, when we see an equation like
\begin{equation}
  x^{2}-x-6 = 0
\end{equation}
we don't compute the general solution; we factor the equation into
\begin{equation}
  \paren{x-3}\paren{x+2} = 0.
\end{equation}
We recognize that there are special cases when the roots can be found by a process that is simpler than the general method.

Similarly, while there is a general method for computing the \svdp \ there is also an elementary method for special cases; such a method will be shown here.

The general SVD requires solving for the eigenvalues of one of the product matrices, either $\prdm{*}$ or $\prdmm{*}$. However, in special cases we can completely bypass the eigenvalue problem and construct the SVD using only Gaussian elimination or even inspection.
