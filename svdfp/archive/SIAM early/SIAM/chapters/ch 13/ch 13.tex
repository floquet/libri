\chapter{Unitary transformations}
Some readers may wonder why the book doesn't end with the previous chapter since we conclude the theory and basic applications of the \svdp. The answer is that we are really just starting our explorations. The SVD is such a beautiful and elegant tool so supremely suited for research and discovery in linear algebra and applied mathematics. Now that we have conquered the rudiments of the decomposition, it is time to see it in action. As you may have guessed  by now, this book is not so much about the \svdl \ as it is about linear algebra.

Another perspective is the analogy of the mountain climber. Certainly part of the reason for climbing the mountain is to take in the breathtaking vistas from the peak. And so we are now going to examine our world using the tools we have developed so far.
