\section{Why least squares?}
Why choose the $2-$norm?
%%%
\begin{enumerate}
%
  \item The norm is continuous and allows for differentiation.
%
  \item Gauss-Markov theorem.
%
  \item The method is familiar, widely accepted and well documented.
%
  \item It embodies the Pythagorean theorem and engenders comfort.
%
\end{enumerate}

The focus of this work is on the {\it{overdetermined}} least squares problem where there are more measurement points than solution parameters. The system has full column rank
$$
  \A{} \in \cmplxall{m}{n}{n}, \quad m \ge n
