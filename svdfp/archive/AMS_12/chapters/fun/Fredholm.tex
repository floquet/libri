\section{The Fredholm Alternative}
The Fredholm Alternative is a foundation concept in functional analysis and linear algebra.

For matrix analysis a useful form of the theorem can be stated this way:

Given a matrix $\A{}\in\cmplx{\by{m}{n}}$ and a vector $b\in\cmplx{\by{n}{1}}$, then only one of the following statements can be true.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Either $\ls$ has one solution,
\item Or $\A{*}y=0$ has a solution where $y^{*}b\ne0$. 
\end{enumerate}
