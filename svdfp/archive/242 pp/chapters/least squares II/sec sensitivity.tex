\section[Sensitivity]{Sensitivity of the least squares solution}

A seminal result in the masterwork by Golub and Van Loan quantifies the sensitivity of the least squares solution. The beauty of this result is that it bounds the sensitivity of the \emph{method} of least squares independent of the \emph{algorithm} used. It answers the question "what is the best possible answer using least squares?" This allows one to evaluate the results from different algorithms in a meaningful way.
