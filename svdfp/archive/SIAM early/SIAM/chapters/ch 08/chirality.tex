\section{Chirality}
Chirality is an important concept which describes the ``handedness'' of the coordinate system. Even though we are restricted to $\real{2}$ in this discussion, we will see that we need to embed this plane in a third dimension. This is because we will see that we are either looking down on the plane (right thumb up) or looking \emph{up} at the plane (left thumb up). We color objects in the plane with a magic paint which is green from above and red from below. This will help us to keep track of the chirality. The axis in the $\hat{e}_{1}$ direction is black. The axis in the $\hat{e}_{2}$ direction is blue. We measure the angle from the $\hat{e}_{1}$ vector to the $\hat{e}_{2}$ in the plane which contains them. (In higher dimension we go from $\hat{e}_{k}$ vector to the $\hat{e}_{k+1}$.)

Here we go from black to blue. Run your fingers along the black line. If they curl in the direction of the blue line, the system is \emph{right handed.} If you must use your left hand fingers to curl in the direction of the blue line then the system is \emph{left-handed.}
