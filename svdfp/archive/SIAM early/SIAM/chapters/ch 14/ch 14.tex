\chapter{The pseudoinverse}
\label{chap:pseudoinverse}
In the last chapter, in equation \eqref{eq:13:bingo}, we derived an expression for the pseudoinverse solution for least squares problem. While very satisfying, the fact that this object generalizes the matrix inverse is far from obvious. Let's now discuss the pseudoinverse in a more general setting in linear algebra, not tied specifically to least squares problems.

The pseudoinverse, or generalized matrix inverse, is a powerful tool in the study of linear systems. We have seen already how this generalization is a potent tool in the arena of least squares problems. We will go on to see that the pseudoinverse and the \svdl \ work together like hand and glove.
