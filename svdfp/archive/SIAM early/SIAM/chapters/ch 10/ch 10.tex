\chapter[The Fundamental Theorem]{The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra}
At last we have arrived! The \ftola \ provides the organizing principles for the science of linear algebra. Often its erudition leaves practitioners feeling the subject is recondite and of secondary importance. The order and manner of presentation of the previous chapters show that we have tacked into this zephyr of ambivalence.

We see that the process of decomposition by singular values is simple in conception and often simple in execution. We see that the convenient perspective rests upon resolution of the row and vector spaces of the target matrix. This is just the Fundamental Theorem in thin disguise. The diagrams and tables are organized around the Fundamental Theorem. The facility of the simple SVD in the first chapter is due to the recognition of the Fundamental Theorem. Success to this point has come with the Fundamental Theorem lurking in the wings. It is time to call our star onto the stage, front and center.
