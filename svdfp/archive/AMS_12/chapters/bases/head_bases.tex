\chapter{The domain matrices}
The domain matrices $\X{}$ and $\Y{}$ conjure considerable mystery. However under closer inspection we that they have elementary interpretations of unitary matrices. These domain matrices can be classified further as one of these types:
\begin{enumerate}
\item rotators
\item minimal spanning sets (bases)
\item reflections
\item permutations
\end{enumerate}

In the following sections we will discuss basic properties of unitary matrices then explore the different categories. 

The following chapters uses the Jordan normal form as a vehicle to probe these domain matrices.

Unitary matrices do not change the norm of a vector in $L_{2}$

Or course the product of unitary matrices are unitary.
