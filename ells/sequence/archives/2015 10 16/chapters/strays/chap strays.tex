\chapter{Strays}

Blindly applying linear tools to nonlinear problems presents many paths to perdition. Hope, no matter how fervent, cannot remedy mathematical maladies.

We stress the definition of the least squares problem in \eqref{eqn:definition} as the first indication that something is amiss. We stress visualization methods to help reveal the status of a calculation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item finding reasonable approximations which nudge the problem into linearity;
\item iterating the solution to a linear problem to improve a nonlinear problem; 
\item separating a problem into linear and nonlinear components.
\end{enumerate}
