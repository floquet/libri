\chapter{The eigensystem problem}

The eigensystem problem - the evaluation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues - lies at the heart of the \svdp. The SVD inherits its difficulties from the eigensystem problem. Certainly, we have showed occasions of good fortune where the eigensystem problem can be bypassed. However, we also saw cases like the full Jordan forms where the eigensystem problem can be extremely onerous.

The literature on eigensystem problems burgeons and a full discussion is extensive.

The concept of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors may seem complicated or recondite. Fortunately, a simple visualization provides a strong conceptual foundation.
